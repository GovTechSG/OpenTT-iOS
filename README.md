# OpenTT-iOS Documentation

This repository contains TraceTogether (iOS) App source codes dated January 2021, and is published for reference. TraceTogether is Singaporeâ€™s national digital Bluetooth contact tracing solution to fight the spread of COVID-19. 

### Statement from the TraceTogether team
>In April 2020, we published OpenTrace, a reference implementation of BlueTrace (BlueTrace is the privacy-preserving protocol upon which TraceTogether is built). Since then, TraceTogether has implemented various improvements, such as interoperability with TraceTogether tokens, SafeEntry venue check-in, COVID Health Status.
>
>In response to public requests, we are publishing TraceTogether app source codes dated January 2021. Sensitive parts such as NRIC validation logic and TraceTogether image assets have been removed from this release. We had hoped to publish this earlier, but the team was caught up supporting increased contact tracing demands in recent months, and there were various security reviews necessary before publishing code.
>
>We thank you for your continued support towards community-driven contact tracing that has been designed, developed and deployed with love.

### Statement from Apple
> To ensure the credibility of health and safety information, Apple is only accepting COVID-19 related apps from recognised entities such as government organisations, health-focused NGOs, companies deeply credentialed in health issues, and medical or educational institutions. Only developers from one of these recognized entities should submit an app related to COVID-19 to the App Store. For more information visit https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=03142020a

### Note about security
We encourage all users of TraceTogether to update their operating systems regularly to get the latest security patches. We also encourage users to always update their app to the latest version.
